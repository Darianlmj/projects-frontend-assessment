# CSESoc Projects Frontend Assessment

In this challenge, you will need to build the frontend for a simple login page.

Currently, the page just consists of a Header and a body containing some text. We need to spruce this page up a little ‚ú®

**Note: We do not expect anyone to complete this assessment. It is made to simulate a mini assignment and might be overwhelming for some. However, if you do end up submitting something, you can bet that we will take under HEAVY consideration. You might also learn something new and interesting from it.**

<h2 id="specifications">1. Specifications üîß</h2>

### 1.1 Warmup
Once you have got the frontend up and running, you will notice that on the Header, there is a text that says "Vue is Fun". Your task here is to change it so that it says "Vue is Mega Fun" or "Vue > React".

### 1.2 Footer
No personal project is complete without a footer that says "Made with love..." am I right? Your task is to make a footer that is positioned at the bottom of the page even if the user scrolls anywhere on the page.

### 1.2 Login Form
- The page shall have a form which allows the user to input their username and password.
- The username field will be displayed as text while the password field will be displayed as password.
- There should be a button that says 'Login'

### 1.3 Login Request
- When the login button is clicked, there should be a modal popup displaying the message that you will receive from the backend
- One of 2 scenarios can occur after clicking the login button:
  1. The user receives a status 401 response, this can happen if either the username or password field is empty or both are empty (i.e. length === 0)
  2. The user receives a status 200 response, this can happen if both the username and password are not empty (i.e. length > 0)

### 1.4 Styling
You are free to express your creativity here, the only limit is your imagination. Note that presentation **will be taken into account** when assessing your work.

<h2 id="extension">2. Extension üèóÔ∏è</h2>
There are a few challenges that you can attempt for those sweet extra bonus points:

### 2.1 Linting
The frontend has a linter set up. Make sure that your code conforms to the linter's style expectations when running the command `pnpm run lint`.

### 2.2 User Profile Page
Make a profile page for the user when logging in. It is up to you how you want this home page to look like.

### 2.3 Tailwind
Some of our flagship projects such as Jobs Board and Chaos uses Tailwindcss to style our components. Your task is to refactor the codebase so that it uses Tailwindcss.

### 2.4 Testing
You've been told that good code coverage and continuous testing is vital to the development process right? If not, it is right. In our flagship projects, you will hardly come across a piece of code that doesn't have some sort of test written for it. Well, for your task here, you will need to set up cypress to test the usability of your website. Write a simple test case that takes the user through the process of logging in. You are welcome to write more test cases if you want to :wink:

*Hint: you may want to take a look into routing for Vue*

<h2 id="getting-started">3. Getting Started üòé</h2>

If you do not have `pnpm` installed, you can do so by running the command `npm install -g pnpm`. Then verify it by running `pnpm --version`.

Starting up the frontend
1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory and run `pnpm install`.
3. Run `pnpm run dev`.
4. Open a browser and go to the URL provided.

Starting up the backend
1. In a seperate terminal, navigate to the `/backend` directory and run `pnpm install`.
2. Run `pnpm run start`.
